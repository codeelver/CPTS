Retired Machines

When we have completed (at least) two modules and are satisfied with our notes and documentation, we can select three different retired machines. These should also differ in difficulty, but we recommend choosing two easy and one medium machines. At the end of each module, you will find recommended retired machines to consider that will help you practice the specific tools and topics covered in the module. These hosts will share one or more attack vectors tied to the module.

With the retired machines, we have a significant advantage in that we can find existing write-ups online from many different authors (all with varying approaches) with which we can compare our notes. If we opt to purchase a VIP membership on the HTB main platform, we will also have access to official HTB write-ups that present another viewpoint and often include some defensive considerations. We can use these write-ups to compare whether we have noted everything necessary and have not overlooked anything. The order in which we can proceed to practice with the retired machines looks something like this:
Step 	Task
1. 	Get the user flag on your own
2. 	Get the root flag on your own
3. 	Write your technical documentation
4. 	Write your non-technical documentation
5. 	Compare your notes with the official write-up (or a community write-up if you don't have a VIP subscription)
6. 	Create a list of information you have missed
7. 	Watch Ippsec's walkthrough and compare it with your notes
8. 	Expand your notes and documentation by adding the missed parts

Finally, we should create technical and non-technical documentation again. We will find that this one will likely be more extensive than the previous ones because we are working with many more topics we need to cover and document here. The most significant advantage of this approach is that we go through the entire penetration testing process, improving the way we capture essential information and have everything we need to prepare our documentation based on our experiences and notes.
